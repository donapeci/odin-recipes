  <h1>My recipes</h1>
  <p>
    Welcome to my small collection of family recipes: simple, homemade treats that bring back the smell of my grandma’s kitchen.
    Each recipe has its own story: the <strong>soft and sweet</strong> <a href="recipes/banana-bread.html">banana bread</a> that reminds me of Sunday mornings,
    the fluffy <a href="recipes/pancake.html">pancakes</a> perfect for lazy breakfasts,
    and the <strong>rich, fudgy</strong> <a href="recipes/brownie.html">brownies</a> that make every occasion feel special.
    I hope you enjoy baking them as much as I enjoy sharing them. 🍌🥞🍫
