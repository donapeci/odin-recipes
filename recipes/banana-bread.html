<h1>Banana bread recipe</h1>
<p> This banana bread is my <strong>grandma's masterpiece</strong>. It's soft, perfectly moist, and smells like comfort. She always said the secret was using very ripe bananas, <em>"the uglier, the better"</em>, she'd laugh.</p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>2 to 3 very ripe bananas</li>
    <li>1/3 cup butter, preferably unsalted</li>
    <li>3/4 cup of sugar</li>
    <li>Two small eggs</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon of vanilla extract</li>
    <li>1 1/2 cup of self-rising flour</li>
</ul>
<h2>Method</h2>
<p>Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F). In the meantime, mash the bananas in a large bowl until smooth, then mix them with the melted butter, sugar, and eggs. Add the vanilla extract and slowly incorporate the flour using a sifter to keep the texture light and airy. Pour the batter into a greased loaf pan and bake until golden and fragrant, about 45-50 minutes. Let it cool on a rack <em>(if you can wait that long!)</em> and enjoy a warm slice with a cup of coffee or tea.</p>
