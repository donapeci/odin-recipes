<h1>Brownie recipe</h1>
<p> This brownie is my grandma’s <em>ultimate indulgence</em> rich, fudgy, and perfectly dense. She always said the secret was to melt the chocolate slowly and never overbake it, so it stays soft in the center. The smell alone fills the kitchen with warmth, and each bite feels like a small celebration of everything sweet and comforting.</p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>200 g dark chocolate (at least 60% cocoa)</li>
    <li>150 g butter</li>
    <li>1 cup sugar</li>
    <li>2 large eggs</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons cocoa powder</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
    <li>A pinch of salt</li>
</ul>
<h2>Method</h2>
<p>Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F). Melt the butter and chocolate together over low heat, stirring until smooth. Remove from the heat and whisk in the sugar, then the eggs one at a time. Add the vanilla extract, sift in the flour, cocoa powder, and salt, and mix gently until combined. Pour the batter into a greased baking tin and bake for about 25–30 minutes, until the top is set but the center is still slightly soft. <strong>Let it cool before cutting</strong></p>
