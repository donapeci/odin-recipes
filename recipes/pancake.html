<h1>Pancakes</h1>
<p>These pancakes were our Sunday morning ritual. My grandma would wake up early, hum a song, and fill the kitchen with the smell of butter and vanilla.</p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul> 
    <li>1 cup of milk</li>
    <li>2 eggs</li>
    <li>1 cup of flour</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons of sugar</li>
    <li>A pinch of salt</li>
    <li><strong>Optional:</strong> 1/4 of chocolate chips <em>(They will end up amazing)</em></li>
</ul>
<h2>Method</h2>
<p>Whisk all the ingredients together in a large bowl until the batter is completely smooth. Make sure not to overmix, the secret to fluffy pancakes is keeping the batter light and airy. Heat a non-stick pan over medium heat and melt a small piece of butter to prevent sticking. Pour small circles of batter (about a quarter cup each) onto the pan. When tiny bubbles begin to form on the surface and the edges start to look set, gently flip each pancake using a spatula. Cook for another minute or two until golden brown on both sides. Serve warm with a drizzle of honey, a spoonful of jam, or even fresh fruit and whipped cream, <em>whatever makes you happiest in the morning.</em></p>
